readme

yo i think we should for now turn the README into a place where we can keep track of current/upcoming features were doing

so like lets start a list and try to order it how were working on it
and put your name next to it if ur workin on it right now and then when we finish it we can just delete it

--Resume Builder (Eric)
--Planner/Reminders? (Sam)
--Main Menu
  -Log Out (Sam)
  -Settings
  -Profile
  -Color Schemes
--Essay Planner
--Volunteer Match
--Coaching preview screens (Dylan?)
--Coaching screen after hitting continue
--Mentor Version of main panels
--Parent Version of main panels

Add whatever you want

also lets just pay for a private repo when we get farther along with the project (-delete this when you see it cuz idk)
